There is a structure of HTML file

<!DOCTYPE html> -> tells the browser which version of HTML to use (in this case, HTML5)

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> -> specifies the character encoding for the HTML document (UTF-8 is a common encoding that supports most characters)
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -> makes the website responsive by setting the viewport width to the device width and initial zoom level to 1
        <title>Document</title> -> sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -> links to an external CSS file for styling the HTML document
    </head> -> contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts (doesn't include visible content, includes info for computer)
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        ...
        ...
        <script src="script.js"></script> -> links to an external JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the HTML document
    </body> -> all of the content of the website goes here, such as text, images, links, etc. (visible content for users)
</html> -> the root element of the HTML document, everyting is inside this tag
