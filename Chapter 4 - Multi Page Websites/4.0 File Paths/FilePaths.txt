A unique location for a file or folder on your computer.

A file path can direct you to a specific file or folder, and it can be absolute or relative.

Root: Hard Drive (usually C:\)
Absolute Path: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\file.txt (relative to the root)
Relative Path: Documents\file.txt (related to the current directory)

For web development, relative file path is more useful than absolute file path. We want to bring up an image, sound, movie or another HTML file, we usually use a relative file path.

Special Characters to Navigate File Paths:
.. : Move up one directory level (go up a level)
. : Current directory (stay in the same directory)
