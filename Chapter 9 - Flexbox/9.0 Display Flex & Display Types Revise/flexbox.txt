Float is great when you want to float an image to the left or the right of a block text to wrap it. 
But don't use floats for layouts.
Instead, use Flexbox for overall page structure.

Flexbox:
Flexbox is a layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
Fexbox makes it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure, without using float or positioning.
Flexbox layout should be used for 1D layout (rows OR columns)

A flexbox always consists of:
    A Flex Container - the parent (container) <div> element with display property set to "flex"
    Flex Items - the items inside the container <div>

Let's say you have different elements by default display (e.g. div -> block, span -> inline, p -> block, img -> inline, etc.),
if you enclose those elements to a flexbox, then all previous display values will be ignored,
everything will be laid out by Flexbox. Width of each element will normally be based on content size.

display: flex -> create flexbox, %100 width, occupying the line
display: inline-flex -> sets the width as much as the container needs and other things can also go and occupy the same line

The CSS properties we use for the flex container are:
    flex-direction (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse -> determines the main axis)
    flex-wrap (nowrap (default), wrap, wrap-reverse)
    flex-flow (sets both wrap and direction values)
    justify-content (in the direction of main axis)
    align-items (in the direction of cross axis (perpendicular to main axis))
    align-content (in the direction of cross axis (perpendicular to main axis))

On the children (flex items):
    flex-basis
    order
    flex-grow
    flex-shrink
    align-self
