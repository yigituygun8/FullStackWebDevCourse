The "align-items" property is used to align the flex items when they do not use all available space on the cross-axis.

The align-items property can have one of the following values:
    -center: positions the flex items in the middle of the container
    -flex-start: positions the flex items at the top of the container
    -flex-end: positions the flex items at the bottom of the container
    -baseline: positions the flex items at the baseline of the container (the line upon which the text sits, you can see better demonstration with different font-sizes)
    -stretch: stretches the flex items to fill the container (this is equal to "normal" which is default)
    -normal: behaves like "stretch" (default)

The align-content property is used to align the flex lines. (flex-wrap must be set to "wrap")
The align-content property is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex "items", it aligns the flex "lines".

The align-content property can have one of the following values:
    -center
    -flex-start
    -flex-end
    -space-around
    -space-between
    -space-evenly
    -stretch

| Property            | Axis it works on | When it works                                              | What it aligns                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **`align-items`**   | Cross axis       | Always                                                     | Each **item** in each **line** |
| **`align-content`** | Cross axis       | Only if `flex-wrap` is on **and** there are multiple lines | The **lines themselves**       |
