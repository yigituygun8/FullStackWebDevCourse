"flex-grow" property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items
The value must be a number, "default value is 0"

Make the third flex item grow eight times faster than the other flex items:
<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">1</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">2</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 8">3</div>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------

"flex-shrink" property specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items
The value must be a number, "default value is 1"

Do not let the third flex item shrink as much as the other flex items:
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex-shrink: 0">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
  <div>5</div>
</div>


content-width < width < flex-basis < min/max width (priority list)

How flex-grow works:
0 → Item will not grow beyond its base (flex-basis) size, even if there’s extra space.
1 → Item will take part in growing when there’s extra space, sharing it equally with other growable items.
2, 3, etc. → Item will grow more than others, proportionally.

Example:
If two items both have flex-grow: 1, they get equal extra space.
If one has flex-grow: 2 and the other 1, the first gets twice as much extra space.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How flex-shrink works:
0 → Item will not shrink below its base size, even if there’s not enough space (might overflow).
1 → Item will shrink proportionally to others with 1 when space is tight.
2, 3, etc. → Item will shrink more quickly than others, proportionally.

Example:
If two items have flex-shrink: 1, they shrink evenly.
If one has flex-shrink: 2 and the other 1, the first sacrifices twice as much space when shrinking.

Defaults:
flex-grow = 0 (no growing by default)
flex-shrink = 1 (shrinking allowed by default)
