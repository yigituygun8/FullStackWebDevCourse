Client (you as a browser) send your message to your ISP 
ISP relays that message to DNS server (domain name system)
DNS server will look into the database to find the exact IP address that you are looking for
PS: Every single computer that is connected to Internet has a unique IP address
Once the IP address is found, it will be sent back to you through your ISP over the Internet so that you can make a direct request

Sum up:
Internet is a bunch of wires and cables that connect computers together.
There are undersea cables that connect continents.
(check submarine cables map).
