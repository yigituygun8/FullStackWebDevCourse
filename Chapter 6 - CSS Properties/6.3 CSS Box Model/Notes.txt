All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. 
    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content (e.g. 10px solid black (thickness, style, color))
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

    Think of it as a set: Margin > Border > Padding > Content

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the total width and height of an element, you must also include the padding and borders.
    The total width of an element should be calculated like this:
    Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border

    The total height of an element should be calculated like this:
    Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border
    Note: The margin property also affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but the margin is not included in the actual size of the box. 
    The box's total width and height stops at the border.

For padding, border and margin, you can set the values for each side of the box individually:
    padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left
    border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left
    margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left

You can also use the shorthand properties:
    padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top, right, bottom, left */ (clockwise direction)
    border-width: 5px 10px 15px 20px; /* top, right, bottom, left */
    margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top, right, bottom, left */

You can also use the shorthand properties with two values:
    padding: 10px 20px; /* top/bottom, right/left */
    border-width: 5px 10px; /* top/bottom, right/left */
    margin: 10px 20px; /* top/bottom, right/left */


If we want to make groups, we will use <div> tag in HTML.
    The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    It is a block-level element that is used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes) or because they share attribute values.
    The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
    Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 
    They are invisible by default unless you apply CSS.

    âš¡ Golden Rule
        Use semantic tags when they fit: <section>, <header>, <footer>, etc.
        Use <div> for neutral boxes or layout wrappers.
        Avoid misusing tags intended for text/headers purely for visual purposes.
