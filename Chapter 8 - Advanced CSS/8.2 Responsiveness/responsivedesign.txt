Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)

How To Create Responsive Websites?:
1) Media Queries: rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      /* Styles for devices with a max-width of 600px */
    }

    Typical Breakpoints: (Breakpoints are the widths at which the layout of a website changes to accommodate different screen sizes)
        /* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
        @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

        /* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
        @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

        /* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
        @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

        /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
        @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

        /* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
        @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}


2) CSS Grid: Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into rows and columns. It makes it easier to place elements on the page.

3) CSS Flexbox: A one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows OR columns. It allows for responsive design by adjusting the size and position of elements based on available space.
4) External Frameworkds (like Bootstrap): Frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-designed components and a grid system that makes it easier to create responsive designs without starting from scratch.
