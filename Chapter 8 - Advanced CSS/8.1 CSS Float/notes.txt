The CSS "float" property specifies how an element should float.

The float property is used for positioning and formatting content.
e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

float:
    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

It is deprecated but still used for wrapping text around images and other elements.


The "clear" property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
clear:
    none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
    left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
    right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
    both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
    inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

PS: When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: 
    If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. 
    Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

!!!!!
In modern development, CSS Flexbox and Grid are preferred for layout over floats, as they provide more control and flexibility for complext layouts.
Only recommended to use floats to wrap text around images or other elements.
