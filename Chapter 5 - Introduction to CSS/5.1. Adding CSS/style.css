/*
There are 3 ways of adding CSS to our HTML:
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

Inline CSS: <tag style="CSS" />
- CSS is written directly in the HTML file using the style attribute.
- It is used to style a specific element or testing a style before adding it to the CSS file.
- It is not recommended to use inline CSS because it is not reusable and makes the code harder to maintain.

Internal CSS: <style>CSS</style>
- CSS is written in the head section of the HTML file.
- It is used to style the entire website.
- It is more efficient than inline CSS.

External CSS: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
- CSS is written in a separate file with a .css extension.
- It is used to style the entire website.
- It is more efficient than inline CSS and internal CSS.

| Type of CSS      | Where written                      | Recommended for                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Inline CSS**   | Directly on the element            | Small changes, testing           |
| **Internal CSS** | Inside `<style>` tags in HTML file | Small projects, one-page styling |
| **External CSS** | In a separate `.css` file          | Big projects, reusable styling   |
