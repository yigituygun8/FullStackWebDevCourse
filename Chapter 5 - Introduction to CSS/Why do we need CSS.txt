CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Style Sheets is a language that allows us to specify how things look like in our website.

CSS was created because HTML was only designed to structure content, not to control its appearance. Before CSS, all styling (like colors, fonts, and layout) had to be done directly in HTML using attributes such as `<font>`, which made web pages hard to maintain and inconsistent in design.

**Why do we need CSS?**
1. **Separation of Content and Presentation:**  
   CSS allows us to keep the structure (HTML) separate from the presentation (CSS). This makes code cleaner and easier to manage.

2. **Consistency:**  
   With CSS, you can apply the same styles to multiple pages or elements, ensuring a consistent look across your website.

3. **Efficiency:**  
   You can change the look of an entire website by editing just one CSS file, instead of updating every HTML file.

4. **More Styling Options:**  
   CSS provides powerful styling features like colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, animations, and responsive design, which are not possible with HTML alone.

5. **Accessibility and Maintainability:**  
   By separating style from content, websites are easier to update and more accessible to users with disabilities.

**Summary:**  
CSS is essential because it gives us control over the visual presentation of our web pages, making them attractive, consistent, and easier to maintain.
