/*
CSS Selectors: it selects the HTML elements to apply styles that go in between curly braces

Types:
1. Element Selector: Selects all elements of a specific type.
    Example: p { color: blue; } selects all <p> elements.

2. Class Selector: Selects all elements with a specific class.
    Has a special syntax using a dot (.) and then the class name without spaces.
    Example: .highlight { background-color: yellow; } selects all elements with class="highlight".
      PS: A class is an attribute that can be added to any HTML element, and it can be used multiple times on the same page. Used for grouping elements.

3. ID Selector: Selects a single element with a specific ID.
    Has a special syntax using a hash (#) and then the ID name without spaces.
    Example: #header { font-size: 24px; } selects the element with id="header".
      PS: An ID is an attribute that can be added to any HTML element, and it should be unique on the page. 
      The id must be unique within one page, but across multiple files, you can reuse the same id.

    So, what is the difference between class and ID?:
      Class is used for grouping multiple elements, while ID is used for identifying a single element.
      ID is used for one element only, while class can be used for multiple elements.

4. Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on their attributes.
    Example: a[href="https://example.com"] { color: red; } selects all <a> elements with href="https://example.com".
              (in square brackets)

5. Universal Selector: Selects all elements on the page.
    Example: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; } selects all elements and removes their default margin and padding.

There are some others which are listed below, we will see them later in our code.
